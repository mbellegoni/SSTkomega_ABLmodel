# SSTkomega_ABLmodel
The repository contains the developed improved SST k-omega turbulence model for the RANS simulation of ABL flows, with a new blending approach to account for the presence of obstacles in the domain.
In addition, the two case studies used for validation, i.e. the CEDVAL A1-1 and CEDVAL B1-1, are uploaded.
